##2015 Robotic Code
##Recycle Rush!

Welcome to the 2015 Season!
This code will be command driven. Should be epicly modular!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is just a set of notes that we can (and probably will) use if we forget how to do something or if someone new needs to say push to the upstream. This will be frequently edited, commented on, added to etc.

Here is the link that takes you to a page that shows HOW to instal the IDE, Plug-ins, and JDK 
https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809/l/145002-installing-eclipse-c-java

---Importing repository from github---

1	File> import> git> projects from git> clone url

2	Take the URL from github and paste it intibthe url slot

3	Fill in the authentication portion> next

4	Make sure "Master" is checked> next

5	Choose where to put the file> next

6	"Importing existing projects" > next

7	If there are any projects to import, then import then. If not then the files have still been imported and to open them, all you have to do is to go through the file pathway and open it manually.

---Pushing to the upstream---

1	When you have edited your code, save

2	Right click on the repository that is located to the left under "Git Repositories" (if it is not shown, go to the Windows tab, go to other, and select git repositories)

3	Click commit

4	Write your description of what the commit is for

5	Check the box(s) for what files your are changing

6	Click "Commit and push"

7	Put in your information and hit "ok"

8	A message will pop up onto the screen displaying the results of the commit and push

9	If done successfully there will not be any signs of failure such as "incomplete, or failed to commit" etc
